## Usage for Development

### Frontend Development
Use the OpenAPI specification to:

2. Mock API responses during development
3. Validate request/response structures
4. Build persona-specific UI components

### Backend Development
Use the specification to:
1. Implement FastAPI endpoints with automatic validation
2. Generate API documentation
3. Create database schemas matching the data models
4. Implement business logic for dual categorization

### Testing
Use mock data for:
1. Component testing with realistic data scenarios
2. Integration testing across different personas
3. Family workflow testing
4. Edge case validation (split transactions, permissions)

## Biblical Stewardship Integration

The API design reflects core biblical financial principles:

### Tithing Priority
- All income detection automatically calculates 10% tithing obligation
- Tithing tracking is prominent across all personas
- Annual giving statements for tax purposes

### Needs vs Wants Classification
- Every transaction requires fixed (needs) or discretionary (wants) classification
- Smart suggestions based on biblical stewardship principles
- Visual indicators helping users make godly financial decisions

### Family Stewardship
- Joint tithing calculation for married couples
- Parental oversight for children's financial education
- Family coordination preventing financial conflict

### Emergency Fund Emphasis
- Single primary savings goal (emergency fund) to avoid complexity
- Persona-appropriate emergency fund targets
- Progress tracking encouraging faithful preparation

This contract enables development teams to work independently while ensuring the final application maintains biblical stewardship principles and serves all 8 target personas effectively.

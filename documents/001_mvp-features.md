# Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Features for Financial Planning and Money Management Application

This document outlines the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) features for a financial planning and money management application based on the biblical principles and practical advice from the *Royal Vision* November-December 2004 issue (RV200411_EN.pdf). The MVP focuses on simplicity, usability, and essential functionality to test viability with users across eight distinct personas (ages 8-65+), prioritizing tithing, budgeting, savings, and goal-based notifications, with Plaid integration as a core component for older users and parent-child collaboration for younger users. The features ensure a functional, user-friendly application that aligns with the document's emphasis on disciplined financial stewardship from childhood through retirement.

## MVP Features

### 1. Plaid Integration for Automated Transaction Data Retrieval
- **Description**: Connect bank accounts and credit cards via Plaid to pull transaction data, account balances, and liability information, reducing manual data entry and enhancing savings goal evaluation, financial planning, and alerts.
- **Implementation**: Use Plaid’s API with Plaid Link for secure authentication to over 12,000 financial institutions. Retrieve transaction details (amount, date, merchant, category) and balances using the Transactions and Balance APIs. Include basic webhook support for real-time updates and Plaid Portal for users to manage or revoke account connections. Ensure AES-256 encryption, TLS, and multi-factor authentication for security.
- **MVP Scope**: Limit to connecting checking, savings, and credit card accounts, focusing on transaction and balance data for budgeting, tithing, and savings tracking.
- **Rationale**: Automates data collection, aligning with the document’s emphasis on disciplined stewardship by minimizing errors and enhancing financial oversight (pages 17, 20-21, 24).

### 2. Tithing Calculator and Tracking
- **Description**: A feature to calculate, track, and remind users to pay their tithe (10% of gross income) before other expenses, ensuring it remains a priority.
- **Implementation**: Provide a calculator that uses Plaid’s transaction data to detect income deposits and calculate 10% for tithing. Allow users to log tithe payments (manual entry for cash income) and set reminders for regular contributions (e.g., post-paycheck alerts).
- **MVP Scope**: Focus on basic tithing calculations and tracking, excluding additional offerings or tax-related features.
- **Rationale**: Reinforces tithing as a fundamental law for God’s blessings, as emphasized in Malachi 3:10 and Deuteronomy 14:22 (pages 12-16).

### 3. Basic Budgeting Tool with Plaid Integration
- **Description**: A simple budgeting tool to create and monitor a monthly budget, categorizing income and expenses into fixed (e.g., rent, utilities) and discretionary (e.g., entertainment) categories.
- **Implementation**: Offer a single, pre-built budget template based on the worksheets from pages 18-19, with categories for fixed and discretionary spending. Use Plaid’s Transactions API to auto-categorize expenses (>90% accuracy) and populate the budget. Include basic alerts for overspending in key categories.
- **MVP Scope**: Limit to one customizable template and basic categorization (e.g., housing, food, transportation).
- **Rationale**: Enables users to live within their means, supporting disciplined financial management (pages 17, 20-21).

### 4. Savings Goal Tracker for Emergency Fund
- **Description**: A feature to set and track a single savings goal, emphasizing a “rainy day fund” for unexpected expenses.
- **Implementation**: Allow users to set one savings goal (e.g., emergency fund) with Plaid tracking deposits to a linked savings account. Provide a simple progress bar and alerts when the goal is at risk or achieved.
- **MVP Scope**: Focus on a single goal with basic tracking.
- **Rationale**: Promotes saving for future needs, ensuring financial stability as per page 21.

### 5. User-Friendly Dashboard
- **Description**: A centralized dashboard displaying an overview of the user’s financial status, including budget status, tithing progress, savings goal progress, and account balances.
- **Implementation**: Aggregate Plaid data (e.g., account balances, recent transactions) to show key metrics. Use simple visuals (e.g., pie chart for budget categories, progress bar for savings) and include a quick-access button for tithing calculations.
- **MVP Scope**: Limit to basic metrics and one chart type (pie chart for budget).
- **Rationale**: Simplifies financial oversight, encouraging regular use and aligning with the document’s emphasis on knowing one’s financial state (page 24).

### 6. Secure Data Management and Privacy Controls
- **Description**: Robust security measures to protect user financial data with complete account isolation, support role management, and automation controls.
- **Implementation**: Turso database architecture with Global database for operations and separate Account database per plan for complete financial data isolation. Auth0 authentication with application-level role management including time-bound Support role and Administrator-controlled Agent role. Use Plaid's AES-256 encryption and TLS with multi-factor authentication.
- **MVP Scope**: Focus on database isolation, basic security (encryption, authentication), Support/Agent role management, and Plaid Portal integration.
- **Rationale**: Builds user trust through complete data isolation, provides flexible support and automation options, essential for handling sensitive financial data while supporting responsible stewardship across all personas.

### 7. Goal-Based Notifications
- **Description**: Push notifications to alert users about financial goal progress (e.g., savings targets, budget adherence) to maintain engagement.
- **Implementation**: Send notifications for milestones (e.g., “You’ve reached 50% of your emergency fund!” or “Budget overspending detected in groceries”). Use Plaid data to trigger alerts based on real-time transactions or savings progress.
- **MVP Scope**: Limit to basic notifications for savings goal progress and budget overspending.
- **Rationale**: Encourages adherence to financial goals, supporting regular evaluation and discipline (pages 15, 21, 24).

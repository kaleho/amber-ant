# Mobile-First Non-Functional Requirements for Web and PWA

## Performance
- **Page Load Time**: Web pages and PWA screens must load within 2 seconds on 4G networks with average signal strength, leveraging service workers for caching.
- **Responsiveness**: UI elements must respond to user interactions within 100 milliseconds on mid-range mobile devices (e.g., 4GB RAM, quad-core processor).
- **Resource Efficiency**: The application must minimize CPU and memory usage, targeting less than 100MB of memory on average mobile browsers.
- **Media Optimization**: Images and videos must use responsive formats (e.g., WebP, `srcset`) and lazy loading, with a low-data mode for slower connections.

## Usability
- **Touch-Friendly Interface**: All interactive elements must have a minimum touch target size of 44x44 pixels to ensure usability on mobile touchscreens.
- **Responsive Design**: The application must adapt seamlessly to screen sizes (320px to 1440px wide) and orientations (portrait and landscape) using responsive design.
- **Accessibility**: Must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards, supporting screen readers and providing high-contrast modes for visually impaired users.
- **Simplified Navigation**: Use linear navigation (e.g., tab bars, bottom navigation) with a maximum of two levels to minimize taps and cognitive load.
- **Form Input Optimization**: Forms must use large input fields, HTML5 input types (e.g., `type="email"`) for correct keyboards, and support autofill, with inline error messages and keyboard-aware layouts.
- **Gesture Support**: Limit to standard gestures (tap, swipe, drag) with visual cues, avoiding conflicts with native browser/OS behaviors.

## Scalability
- **Network Variability**: The application must function reliably on networks from 2G to 5G, with progressive enhancement for non-critical features on slower connections.
- **Offline Capability**: PWA must support offline access to core functionalities (e.g., cached content) using service workers, syncing data when connectivity is restored.

## Security
- **Data Encryption**: All data transmitted must use HTTPS with TLS 1.3 or higher to secure communication between the client and server.
- **Secure Storage**: Sensitive data (e.g., authentication tokens) must be stored securely using browser APIs like Web Storage or IndexedDB with encryption.
- **Session Management**: Sessions must time out after 10 minutes of inactivity, requiring re-authentication to protect user data.

## Compatibility
- **Browser Support**: The application must support the latest versions of Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge on mobile devices, covering iOS 15+ and Android 10+.
- **PWA Installation**: The PWA must be installable on home screens with a valid web app manifest supporting icons for various resolutions and offline capabilities.
- **Browser Chrome Handling**: Use CSS techniques (e.g., `env()`, `min-height`) to account for browser chrome and safe areas, ensuring content is not obscured.

## Reliability
- **Error Handling**: Must display user-friendly error messages for network failures or invalid inputs, with retry options where applicable.
- **Service Worker Stability**: PWA service workers must maintain a 99.5% success rate for caching and serving content without failures.

## Maintainability
- **Code Modularity**: The codebase must use a modular architecture (e.g., component-based frameworks like React) to simplify updates and maintenance.
- **Analytics Integration**: Must include lightweight analytics for tracking usage and performance metrics, optimized for minimal impact on mobile browser performance.

## Patterns to Avoid
- **No Modals**: Avoid modals/overlays; use inline expansions, slide-in panels, or full-screen views for additional content or forms, withресп
